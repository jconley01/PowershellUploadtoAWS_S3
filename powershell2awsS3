#the below shows how to use a native powershell command to upload files to an AWS S3 bucket without the need to install AWSCLI
#I did this because I needed a way for my clients to be able to annonymously upload files to an S3 bucket to report on status when not on a corporate network
#you will need to follow these instructions to allow your bucket to receive public uploads.  Please set the permissions for the bucket properly so its not wide open.

$headers = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[String],[String]]"
$headers.Add("Host","<replacewithbucketname>.s3.amazonaws.com")
$headers.Add("ContentType","application/octet-stream")
#if needed you could add authentication here as well

#in this example we will create a file with the hostname of the computer doing the uploading
$hostname = hostname #get the hostname of the computer
New-Item -Path . -Name "$hostname.txt" -ItemType "file" -Value "add the body of the file here" -Force
$filename = $hostname + ".txt"
